The District may operate the local transit system or contract with any other public or private entity to operate all or part of the transit system including, but not limited to services, facilities, or equipment. Employees represent the District and further the District’s purpose when performing services. District employees are an essential asset, and it is the desire of the District to ensure employees are treated accordingly.\nMarin County Transit District’s enabling legislation requires the District to adopt a Merit System with regard to personnel management (Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 70076). The District established a Merit System by Resolution 2014-11 and authorized the General Manager to prepare or cause to be prepared a Manual of Personnel Policies and Procedures for the effective administration of personnel matters consistent with the Merit System.\nThis Manual is intended to be consistent with applicable federal and state law. In the event of a conflict between this Manual and applicable law, the law shall control."

Employment may be terminated at any time during this period with or without cause or notice, subject to applicable law. Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment and does not change the at-will nature of the employment relationship, where applicable.\n3.5.1\tPurpose:  During this period, the employee and the supervisor evaluate employment suitability in terms of skill, knowledge, performance, and compatibility. New employees are encouraged to ask questions, seek information, and learn the expectations of the position as well as the personal conduct and interpersonal relationships required to be effective in the role. Supervisors provide close direction and provide the job description, orientation to the District culture and policies, and set performance goals. The supervisor will educate the employee about competencies required for success in the position, provide feedback regarding progress, and assess whether the employee meets the expectations of the position. Nothing in this section limits the District’s obligation to provide reasonable accommodation or prohibits employees from engaging in protected activity under applicable law.\n3.5.2\tCompletion:  If the supervisor determines the employee’s performance and conduct meets expectations, the supervisor will complete an Introductory Work Period performance review which includes performance and conduct goals for the next six months and establishes the annual performance evaluation period. Successful completion of the introductory period shall result in 'regular' status for merit system employees but shall not alter the 'at-will' status of any employee designated as such under Section 1.4 of this manual.\n3.5.3\tExtension: The District may extend an employee’s Introductory Work Period when, in the District’s judgment, an extension is necessary to allow adequate evaluation of the employee’s performance and suitability for the position. Circumstances that may warrant an extension include, but are not limited to, extended absences, modified or limited work assignments, or documented performance concerns. Any extension will be communicated to the employee in writing, including the length of the extension and the reason for the extension."

If further discussion is desired, the employee may request a follow-up meeting with the General Manager or designee.\n4.8.4\tProcess for Requesting Reasonable Accommodation in the Hiring Process:\n4.8.4.a\tApplicant Request for Accommodation: A job applicant who requires accommodation in order to participate in the hiring process should submit an accommodation request with the employment application or at any other time during the selection process.\n4.8.4.b\tInteractive Process with the Applicant: The District’s human resources representative will contact the applicant to discuss the needed accommodation and possible alternatives.\n4.8.4.c\tApproval and Provision of Accommodation: If accommodation is reasonable and is approved, the human resources representative will take the necessary steps to see that the accommodation is provided."
